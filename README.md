# Hello, code ninjas!
        
This is my approach to the amazon india *travelling code ninja* programming challange. **Just for fun,** the code is written in plain [vanilla javascript][1] which is not actually part of the test.

You may want to take the challange yourself [here][2] and if you'll make it, you may want to apply at Amazon. Or, if you are more keen on working in Berlin/Germanyâ€¦ maybe you want to apply for my team @ [ZEIT ONLINE][3]. Feel free to contact [me on Twitter][4] or here on github.

Best case would certainly be, you fork this code and make better (even also just for fun).
